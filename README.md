# CUDA-Device-Capabilities

The CUDA library provides some simple mechanisms for testing the available compute device for all the
various parameters used when deciding how to size up a parallel task. This lab involves writing a program
that displays most of these parameters, in order to get a feel for the scale of the device you'll be using.
